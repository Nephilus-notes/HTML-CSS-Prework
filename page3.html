            <p> After starting at COCA at the age of 9, dancing with COCADance and being a part of Ballet Eclectica's inaugural season, 
                Charles moved to Chicago to study at Ballet Chicago. This was his introduction to Balanchine ballet, 
                and the beginning of a path that brought him to the School Of American Ballet at 15.  After performing the lead role in Bourr√©e Fantasque
            in SAB's 2010 workshop performance, Charles moved to Seattle to be a part of Pacific Northwest Ballet's Professional Division.</p>

            <p>After returning to the States, Charles moved away from concert dance and began to meld his two great loves: singing and dance. 
                After going on the road in 2018 with the first National Tour of Aladdin, Charles moved into a sound that was a little more home for him:
                Jesus Christ Superstar.  During the performance he jump, kicked, lifted, and sang his heart out every night
                while beforehand he rehearsed and ensured the safety his cast as Fight Captain and assistant Dance Captain. <br>
