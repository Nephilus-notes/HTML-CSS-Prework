                <p>From my parents practicing to the recording I do now, music 
                    has always been a huge part of my life. Growing up I started 
                    with the violin and viola, moving to piano, and finally guitar and voice.
                But I always sang, singing along to all the musicals my mom 
                played at the Fox Theatre and reenacting scenes I only imagined. 
            I'm still imagining scenes, but now I get to perform them for an audience.</p>

                <p>After dancing professionally for several years, I decided to 
                    combine my two passions in musical theatre. So began a 
                    whirlwind couple of years full of hundreds of auditions, 
                    performances, and dozens of different States, cities, and 
                    theaters. I joined the First National Tour of Aladdin in 
                    spring of 2018 and the next year joined the 50th Anniversary 
                    Tour of Jesus Christ Superstar, traveling across the
                     United States and performing 8 shows a week. The road took 
                     its toll however, and I decided to take a break from the

                    Charles is writing and recording his own music. With his theatrical background, 
                    Charles crafts whole worlds in each of his songs.  With an edge of metal,
