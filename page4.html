                        <p>My mom taught me how to sew and use a sewing machine when I was young, and helped me to leanrn
                            how to make my own costumes. 
                            Then I went off on my own to learn leather working
                            so that I could make gauntlets, and, eventually, armor. </p>

                        <p>Since reading Dragonlance and Tolkien as a child I have 
                            always made up my own world to put stories in.  From creating Dralfian,
                        elves morphed by magic into powerful half dragon hybrids, 
                    to how goblins wered forced underground and emerged as short, 
                stunted creatures with black bones and skin that glows with bioluminescence, Kraethor 
                has a rich history I've still barely scratched the surface of. </p>

                        <p>From reading the old Dragonlance books, 
                            playing various generations of D&D, finding as many options 
                        in rpgs as I can, or creating my own world to make
                    stories and campaigns in, fantasy has always
                     had a special place in my heart. <br>Now, with coding, I have 
                a new way to put those stories together and give them to my 
                friends, family, and the world.<br>
